CodeBook.md describes the variables, data and processes I performed to clean up the data

run_analysis.R performs data preparation followed by 5 steps as per instructed in this course project:

Steps
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

result_data.txt is tidy data set with the average of each variable for eac activity and each subject as per describe in step 5, after step 1- 4 are performed.
